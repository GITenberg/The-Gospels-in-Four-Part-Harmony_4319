xist and is kept at Cambridge University Library in England. The original source of MS Pepys 2498 (referred to as the Pepys Gospel or the Pepys Gospel Harmony) is unknown but some scholars have theorized that it may be as old as Christianity itself. 

\par 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 One\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
 of the more interesting conclusions concerning Jesus based on the Pepys Gospel Harmony (PGH) sequence is that Jesus was a North Palestinian Essene associated with the Damascus Covenant found at Qumran in Palestine and Genizah in Egypt. Furthermore, it ha
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 s\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
 been proposed that Jesus held the office of  Messiah defined in the Damascus Covenant and His goal as well as that of the other Damascus Covenant Essenes was to convert the Pharisaical Jews of Judea which they viewed as the lost sheep of Israel to the Es
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 s\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
ene sect of Judaism. The sequence of events in the gospels as depicted in the PGH shows John the Baptist and Jesus converting Judean Jews through baptism in the wilderness of Judea. Jesus has an altercation at the temple in Jerusalem and John is arrested.
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36  \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 After John\hich\f36 \rquote \loch\f36 s arrest, Jesus heads north all the way to Capernaum where he gathers followers numbering in the thousands. After John\hich\f36 \rquote \loch\f36 
s death, Jesus makes a final journey to Jerusalem and once more he and his followers from Northern Palestine convert Judean J\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 e\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
ws. The Pharisaical leaders of the Judean Jews plot to kill Jesus and put an end to His teaching. 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 Thus, the PGH sequence of the canonical gospels depicts what some scholars believe to have been a sectarian struggle between the Essenes who adhered to the \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
Damascus Covenant in Northern Palestine and the Pharisaical Jews in Judea for religious leadership of all Israelites. The Pharisaical Jews in Judea were looking for a Messiah to vanquish their enemies, Rome and the Herodians, and therefore rejected Jesus 
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 a\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 s their Messiah. Whereas, the Essenes were looking for a Messiah to vanquish their enemies, death, poverty, disease and infirmity, and therefore hailed Jesus as their Messiah.
\par 
\par \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 Below are some important academic notes concerning the PGH sequence of the gosp\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 els:
\par 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
The PGH mentions the city of Gerasa which was an ancient city in Palestine which was destroyed by the 10th Roman legion Firensis in AD 70. Only the very oldest existing manuscripts of the  canonical gospels mention the city of Gerasa while later man
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 uscripts refer to the area as the land of the Gerasenes. Thus the author of the original source of the PGH may have lived prior to AD 70.
\par 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 The sequence of the PGH also parallels many aspects of the theoretical "Q" text. The Greek texts of Matthew and Luke\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 \hich\f36 
 in some areas are letter for letter matches which have led some scholars to theorize that at one time a single text \'93\loch\f36 \hich\f36 Q\'94\loch\f36 
 was formed from an early form of Matthew and of Luke and then later portions of our modern forms of Matthew and Luke were copied from \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 t\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
his single gospel text. Additionally, in the modern text of Luke the "Parable of the Lamp" occurs in both Chapter 8 and Chapter 11. It has been theorized that an early text that contained Luke had only one "Parable of the Lamp" and that the parable was ei
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 t\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
her cut in half or duplicated in our modern texts. The PGH sequence combines portions of Luke Ch. 8 and 11 and only has a single account of the "Parable of the Lamp" just as some scholars have theorized would've existed in the single gospel forerunner of 
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 t\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 he modern text of Luke.
\par 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
Scholars have also theorized that the "Q" text would've been constructed into categories and composed of lists such as a list of parables. This idea was formulated in part based on the gospel of Thomas found at Nag Hammadi. The PG
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 \hich\f36 H does form the gospel account into categories or groupings and there are two major groupings of parables in its sequence just as theorized for the \'93\loch\f36 \hich\f36 Q\'94\loch\f36  text. 
\par 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
The event sequence of the PGH also enhances the account of the four gospels. The sequence produces cause and effect relationships between events and the interactions of various individuals with each other and with Jesus. For instance, The PGH sequence con
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 t\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
ains both Mary Magdalene's conversion and subsequent discipleship (this is in the modern gospel texts but is somewhat obscured due to their non-chronological sequence). Thus Mary Magdalene plays a major role in the account of Jesus which is implied by man
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 y\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
 ancient sources such as the gospel of Thomas but not highlighted by the canonical gospels in their present sequence. The same is true for the significance of John the Baptist in Jesus' ministry. In the PGH sequence, John the Baptist is portrayed as an im
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 p\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
ortant ally of Jesus' ministry and his arrest and later death are both pivotal moments in Jesus ministry as portrayed by the PGH sequence. The importance of John the Baptist in the ministry of Jesus is implied by many ancient sources and that importance i
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 s\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36  vividly depicted in Jesus\hich\f36 \rquote \loch\f36  ministry using the PGH sequence of the canonical gospels. 
\par 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 Moreover, the PGH is the only manuscript in existence which depicts an error free chronological sequence for the events in the life of Jesus as portrayed in the four c\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
anonical gospels. The four canonical gospels make no claim to being written in chronological sequence. There are historical/traditional accounts that indicate that the four canonical gospels were not written in chronological order. For instance, Papias (A
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 D\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
 135) indicated that Mark was not in any particular order. An engineered reconstruction of the chronological order of the gospels indicates that while several sequences are possible -- the sequence of the modern gospels is not in chronological order. For 
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 i\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
nstance, the passage in Mark 3:13-19 not only precedes the passage in Mark 3:20-31 by over a dozen events but in fact several passages in Mark actually occur between Mark 3:13-19 and Mark 3:20-31. 
\par 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 Also, while there have been many modern attempts to reco\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 \hich\f36 
nstruct the sequence of the events of Jesus life as narrated in the four canonical gospels none of these reconstructions has as many parallels to the theoretical \'93\loch\f36 \hich\f36 Q\'94\loch\f36 \hich\f36 
 text as the PGH. Furthermore the theory for the \'93\loch\f36 \hich\f36 Q\'94\loch\f36  text was first proposed in the 1800\hich\f36 \rquote \loch\f36 s\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36  \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 \hich\f36 
and the PGH manuscript predates the \'93\loch\f36 \hich\f36 Q\'94\loch\f36 \hich\f36  text theory by 400 years. Thus the best candidate to date for the \'93\loch\f36 \hich\f36 Q\'94\loch\f36  text sequence is the PGH manuscript. 
\par 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 More importantly, the best manuscript for a chronological depiction of the actual sequence of events in th\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 e life of Jesus is The Pepys Gospel Harmony MS 2498.

\par \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 32 This Jesus God raised up again, and of that we are all witnesses. 33 Be\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
ing therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this which you see and hear. 34 For David did not ascend into heaven, but he says himself: 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 'The Lord said to my Lord, 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 "Sit at my right hand, 
\par \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 35\tab \tab until I make your enemies a footstool 
\par \tab \tab \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 for your feet."' 
\par \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified." 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 37 Now when they heard this they\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
 were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brethren, what shall we do?" 38 And Peter said to them, "Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins; and you will receive t
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 h\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
e gift of the Holy Spirit. 39 For the promise is for you and your children and for all who are far off, for all whom the Lord our God will call to himself." 40 And he testified with many other words and exhorted them, saying, "Save yourselves from this pe
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 r\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
verse generation." 41 So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. 42 They devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and to the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and to prayer. 
\par \tab \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 43 Everyone \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
was filled with awe; and many wonders and signs were done through the apostles. 44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common; 45 and they sold their possessions and goods and distributed them to all, as anyone had need. 46 And day by
\hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36  \hich\af36\dbch\af13\loch\f36 
day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they ate together with glad and sincere hearts, 47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.
